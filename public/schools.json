    "description": "City Montessori School (CMS), a name synonymous with quality education, is the world’s largest school, with over 60,000 students and 4,500 staff across 21 campuses in the city of Lucknow. Founded in 1959 with 5 children on borrowed capital of 300 Rupees by Dr. Jagdish Gandhi and Dr. Bharti Gandhi, CMS is affiliated with the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE). CMS students from Montessori to Class XII achieve some of the best exam results in India. The couple started CMS with a vision to inspire generations of children to become socially motivated and conscious citizens of India and the world. Their motto “Jai Jagat” - 'Hail the World', in contrast to the popular post-Independence greeting, 'Jai Hind' ('Hail India') at the time of the school's inception - has been the school's greeting to date. CMS, therefore, places great emphasis on children's all-round development, moral character building, inculcating a global outlook, and providing international exposure.",
